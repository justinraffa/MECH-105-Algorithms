This is a function that estimates the root of a function using the false position method.   
   
 Inputs 
 * The function being evaluated   
 * The lower geuss  
 * The upper geuss  
 * Desired relative error 
 * Maximum number of iterations 
  
 *If no relative error or maximum iterations are given they will be defaulted to 0.0001% and 200*
  
Outputs
* The root location 
* The function evaluated at that point  
* Approximate relative error as a percent 
* The number of iterations performed
